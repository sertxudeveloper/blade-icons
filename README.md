This package provides a collection of custom icons for Laravel Blade. It is based on Blade Icons from Blade UI Kit.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Laravel 11.x or higher

## Installation

```bash
composer require sertxudeveloper/blade-icons
```

## Blade Icons

Blade Icons - Sertxu's Collection uses Blade Icons from Blade UI Kit under the hood. Please refer to [the Blade Icons readme](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) for additional functionality. We also recommend to [enable icon caching](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#caching) with this library.

## Configuration

Blade Icons - Sertxu's Collection also offers the ability to use features from Blade Icons like default classes, default attributes, etc. If you'd like to configure these, publish the `icons.php` config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=icons-config
```

## Usage

Icons can be used as self-closing Blade components which will be compiled to SVG icons:

```blade
<x-icon-home/>
```

You can also pass classes to your icon components:

```blade
<x-icon-home class="w-6 h-6 text-gray-500"/>
```

And even use inline styles:

```blade
<x-icon-home style="color: #555"/>
```

The solid icons can be referenced like this:

```blade
<x-icon-home/>
```

## Testing

This package contains tests, you can run them using the following command:

```bash
composer test
```
